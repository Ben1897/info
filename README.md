# An Information-Theoretic Framework for Causal History Analysis in Complex System Dynamics
===========================================================================================

## Introduction
This is an open-source program for evaluating the complex system dynamics by using a recently-proposed causal history analysis framework.

## Requirements
1. Add the folder into your environment variable PYTHONPATH.
2. Create the environment from the `environment.yml` file by:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
3. Generate the dynamic libraries for the Kernal Density Estimation (KDE) GPU by:
```
cd [info_folder]/info/info/utils/
make clean; make
```
5. Generate the dynamic libraries for the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) GPU by (Note that it is suggested to use scipy's own KNN approach):
    - Download the [Fast K-Nearest Neighbor search with GPU](https://github.com/PeishiJiang/knn_cuda) (Note that in Peishi's version the distance calculation is based on the maximum norm).
    - Specify `PYTHON_INCLUDE`, `PYTHON_LIB`, `CUDA_DIR` correctly in the `Makefile.config`.
    - Install [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) to enable the connection between C++ and Python code.
    - Type `make` to generate the `knn.so` dynamic library.
    - Copy `knn.so` to the utility folder by typing:
```
cp [knn-folder]/knn.so [info-folder]/info/info/utils/
```
